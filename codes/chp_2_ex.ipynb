    "- The classical models include the moving average (MA), autoregressive (AR), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models.\n",
    "- If historical observations are obtained from error terms, we refer to this as a moving average; if these observations come out of time series itself, it is called autoregressive.\n",
    "- Having data with a correlated structure in time implies a violation of the famous identically and independently distributed (IID) assumption, which is at the heart of many models. Hence, due to the correlation in time, the dynamics of a timeseries mayb be better understood by its own historical values.\n"
